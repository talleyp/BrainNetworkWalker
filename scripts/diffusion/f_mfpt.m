MFPT = (repmat(diag(Z)',n,1)-Z)./W;  % this performs MFPT(i,j)=(Z(j,j)-Z(i,j))/w(j) in a matricial way. Corresponds to theorem 11.16 pag. 459
r = 1./w; %as demostrated in theorem 11.15 pag. 455. Each entry r_i is the 'mean-recurrence' or 'return-time' of state i (node i when states represent nodes of a graph)
